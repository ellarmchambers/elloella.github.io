                            <p>Ella became an invaluable part of a number of projects very quickly. Ella’s work is quality-driven and set by her own high standards, and she was never afraid to ask questions and take any opportunity to learn something new or help where she could. A natural technophile, her skills are superb and she was able to learn new programs and increase her knowledge naturally with excitement and drive.</p>

                            <p>Ella very kindly presented a talk for my students about her recent placement experience. She came across very well, being enthusiastic, professional and articulate. I’m sure she has inspired and helped my students to apply for similar placements in these uncertain times. I would not hesitate to recommend Ella as a reliable, willing and capable tem member and I am certain she has an extremely bright future when she graduates next year.</p>

                            <p>Ella came to us as a placement developer and it was clear from the start that she was a very driven individual. During her time here, she has worked on a number of new technologies that she hadn’t encountered before and taken a lot of knowledge under her wing. She is very helpful person and is always keen to learn. Given her current pace of learning and confidence, I can see Ella going far!</p>
