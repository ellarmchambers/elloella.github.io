                            <p class="section-paragraph">It was in my final year of university that I further developed my passion for ‘tech for good’ and realised that I wanted to specifically focus on the wellbeing of users. This led me to create a dissertation piece that explored the link between UX design and wellbeing.</p>
                            <p class="section-paragraph">From this ‘The Ethical Social Media Project’ was born, created in 2021 this project combined my passions and allowed me to create a dissertation that had true meaning and to me, felt powerful.</p>

                    <p class="section-paragraph">While at university we had a number of modules that gave us the opportunity to create speculative platforms, for each one I focused on creating pieces that would positively impact the lives of users. You can read about some of them below, get in touch if you want to see any designs or prototypes.</p>

                             <h3>Jengu</h3>
                            <p>Jengu came to life in my second year of uni. It was a speculative platform that was created to help those who suffer from diabetes. The concept being that it would provide users with an online application that would enable them to track & manage their condition, erasing the need for paper diaries.</p>
                            <p>Its features would allow GPs to monitor their patients’ health and communicate with them directly through the platform. Jengu would have eased the lives of patients and hopefully eliminate some of the stress that comes with managing diabetes.</p>

                             <h3>Etu</h3>
                            <p>Etu was one of the platforms I created at the start of my final year. I was particularly passionate about the link between poor mental health and social media, that’s the origin of Etu. Etu was a speculative mobile app that would help users have a healthier relationship with their phone.</p>
                            <p>Mobile apps were (and still are) becoming increasingly addictive and I saw how built in digital wellbeing apps didn’t actually prevent users from spending time on their phone. Etu would have helped to create more conscious users and provide rewards, and consequences for going over app limits.</p>
